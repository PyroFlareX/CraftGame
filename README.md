# CraftGame
 An MC clone written to practice more C++, and as a pet project to think about

# Hopes
 Gamestate System
 Separation of Input, World, Graphics, and such
 Multithreading (rendering thread, chunk threads sorta thing)
 Readable and optimized
 Registry based system for assets and data
 Event System?
 Saving world to file?

# Dreams
 Networking with a server - client model
 A not dumb build system
 Actually something more than a voxel terrain generator
 Having an item system
 Crafting system
 Mods? Or at least implement some loved minecraft mods into the game

# Skyscraper Goals
 Audio
 Mobs
 VR (actually a possibility)
 Multiple Rendering backends (So use not just opengl, but maybe have a Vulkan backend too)
 TBD
